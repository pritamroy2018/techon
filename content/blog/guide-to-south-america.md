## **Rio de Janeiro – Brazil**

If you’re looking for a [romantic getaway](https://guidetour.in/romantic-getaway-in-canada/), we’d definitely recommend visiting Rio de Janeiro. Its beautiful landscapes and hilltop views would be the perfect place to woo the person you love: especially if you are planning on proposing any time soon. This patch of paradise is also set to be the site for the 2016 [Olympic games](https://olympics.com/en/) – get there before everyone else beats you to it! Must-see places include Corcovado Mountain and the Rio markets.

##  **Cusco – Peru**

If you’re after somewhere that’s bursting with character and lots of culture to soak up, Cusco is the place for you. Take a wander around its lavishly historic centre: beautiful architecture, quaint fountains and absolutely droves of restaurants to sate you after all the exploring. Don’t leave without a visit to both the church of Santa Domingo and the Qoriacancha palace – you’ll understand when you see them. 

## **Sao Paulo – Brazil**

If tradition and history doesn’t really do it for you, get a little more metropolitan by visiting the largest city in all of [South America](https://guidetour.in/south-america-tourist-attractions/): Sao Paulo. For modern architecture, slick bars and eateries, with the chicest of boutiques, give this place a look. If you want to get back into the [history of Brazil](https://guidetour.in/traveling-to-brazil/), there are plenty of world class museums and tours that you can join – have a look online before visiting to book in advance and save some money. 

## **Cartagena – Columbia**

To get away from all the hustle and bustle, take a stroll around the divine fishing village of Cartagena. Situated on the Caribbean coast, you can while away a blissful day in its centre – get some authentic fish for lunch in one of its restaurants and then watch the sun go down at the beachfront in the evening. This is a great place to visit if you’re an older traveller who prefers to take it a little slow. 

## **Foz do Iguacu – Brazil**

Our ultimate place to visit in South America has to be Foz do Iguacu. If you haven’t seen it before: get Googling pronto – you won’t be able to get it out of your head. Out of this world scenery of [waterfalls](https://guidetour.in/10-most-inspiring-waterfalls-in-the-world-for-you-to-visit/) and natural landscapes: even spot howler monkeys and jaguars in the depths of the forests. If you can get to this place: do it. We’re jealous just thinking about it. Look into finding a tour guide; you don’t want to fall into the path of a dangerous predator on your own!
