## **Be colourful in Chinatown**

Most versions of Chinatown the world over are colourful and vibrant, but this is as close as you’re going to get without actually being there! Locals meander around, mingling with tourists, with [street food](https://guidetour.in/street-foods-of-the-paris/) and traditional restaurants, ideal to check out the local seafood and other cuisines; chilli crab is a must try!  

## **Nocturnal safari fun**

[Singapore Zoo](https://www.visitsingapore.com/en_in/see-do-singapore/nature-wildlife/fun-with-animals/singapore-zoo/) during the day is fun and packed with life-like enclosures, making you feel like you’re within the animals’ own habitat, however the night safari is a definite must-do. Bushwalk trails, tram safari, as well as the fun and educational Creatures of the night show will fill your evening with a difference.  

## **Adrenaline-fuelled fun at Universal Studios**

Cutting edge rides, shows, and interactive entertainment is as standard at Universal Studios, and if you fancy a change from city life, and a chance to scream at the top of your lungs, this is fun with a capital F, as well as being hugely popular, so get there early or book in advance.  

## **Bukit Timah Nature Reserve**

Singapore’s highest peak is surrounded by a beautiful, untouched reserve of rainforest, with many walking trails, the main one taking you right up to the summit of the peak. You’ll pass beautiful scenery, as well as making friends with the odd monkey, many birds, and you could spot a python – from a distance of course!  

## **Cruise the Singapore River** 

Bumboats might sound odd, but they are actually a traditional form of water transportation, so for a fun, cultural adventure, this is a must! Full of charm, you’ll chug along the [Singapore](https://guidetour.in/singapore-city/) River, passing traditional architecture.   

## **Pose in Merlion Park**

A photo beside the famous half fish/half lion monument which squirts out water is a must for your trip to Singapore. This is actually a national icon, but also a very famous photo opportunity.  

Fun in Singapore isn’t hard to find, and these are only a handful of suggestions. Explore the Lion City and see what other fun you can stumble across!
